# Security Configuration - Phase 5 Academic Compliance

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security implementation for the Dizzy's Disease game project, including runtime security validation, export security presets, and academic compliance verification.

## Security Implementation Summary

### ✅ Phase 5 Completed Features

1. **Enhanced Export Presets with Encryption**
   - Windows Desktop: Full PCK and directory encryption enabled
   - Linux Desktop: Complete security configuration with x86_64 architecture
   - macOS Desktop: Comprehensive security with app sandbox and code signing preparation
   - HTML5: Selective encryption for web deployment

2. **Comprehensive Security Validation Suite**
   - Runtime security testing (`scripts/security-tests.js`)
   - Export security validation (`scripts/export-security-validation.js`)
   - Comprehensive security audit (`scripts/comprehensive-security-audit.js`)

3. **Academic Compliance Verification**
   - Multi-platform export security
   - Code security analysis
   - Documentation compliance
   - Feature completeness validation

## Export Security Configuration

### Desktop Platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS)
```
encryption_include_filters="*.gd,*.cs,*.json,*.cfg"
encrypt_pck=true
encrypt_directory=true
exclude_filter="*.pdb,*.tmp,*.log,development/*,debug/*"
```

### Web Platform (HTML5)
```
encryption_include_filters="*.gd,*.json,*.cfg"
encrypt_pck=true
exclude_filter="*.pdb,*.tmp,*.log,development/*,debug/*"
```

- ✅ Encryption usage validation

## Academic Compliance

### Required Documentation ✅
- README.md - Project overview and setup
- CHANGELOG.md - Version history and changes
- export_presets.cfg - Secure export configuration
- project.godot - Game engine configuration

### Security Implementation ✅
- Multi-layered security testing suite
- Export security validation
- Runtime security verification
- Code security analysis

### Academic Features ✅
- Comprehensive AI system with 5 zombie types
- Difficulty scaling system with 5 presets
- Data persistence with SQLite database
- Performance monitoring and logging

## Security Audit Results

The comprehensive security audit evaluates four critical domains:

1. **Runtime Security Validation** - API endpoint security
2. **Export Security Validation** - Build and deployment security
3. **Code Security Analysis** - Source code security patterns
4. **Academic Compliance Check** - Requirement fulfillment

### Audit Scoring
- **Passing Score:** 70/100 minimum for academic compliance
- **Production Score:** 80/100 recommended for deployment
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** All security domains evaluated

## Deployment Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment ✅
- [ ] Run comprehensive security audit
- [ ] Validate export presets configuration
- [ ] Verify encryption settings
- [ ] Test security validation suite
- [ ] Review security audit report

### Export Configuration ✅
- [ ] Enable PCK encryption for all platforms
- [ ] Configure file exclusion filters
- [ ] Set platform-specific security features
- [ ] Validate export directory structure
- [ ] Test export integrity

### Runtime Security ✅
- [ ] Verify API endpoint protection
- [ ] Test authentication system
- [ ] Validate input sanitization
- [ ] Check security headers
- [ ] Monitor security metrics

## Security Best Practices

### Development
1. **Never commit sensitive data** (passwords, keys, tokens)
2. **Use encryption for sensitive files** (scripts, configuration)
3. **Implement comprehensive input validation**
4. **Follow secure coding patterns**
5. **Regular security testing and audits**

### Export and Distribution
1. **Always enable PCK encryption** for production builds
2. **Exclude development files** from exports
3. **Use secure distribution channels**
4. **Validate export integrity** before release
5. **Implement update mechanisms** with signature verification

### Platform-Specific Security
- **Windows:** Consider code signing for commercial distribution
- **macOS:** Enable app sandbox and notarization for App Store
- **Linux:** Validate dependencies and file permissions
- **Web:** Use HTTPS and Content Security Policy headers

## Security Maintenance

### Regular Audits
- Run security validation before each release
- Update security configurations as needed
- Monitor for new security vulnerabilities
- Review and update security documentation

### Continuous Improvement
- Implement additional security measures based on threat landscape
- Update export configurations for new platform requirements
- Enhance security testing coverage
- Regular security training and awareness
