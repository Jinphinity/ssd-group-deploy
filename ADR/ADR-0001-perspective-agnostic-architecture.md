**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Category**: System Architecture
**Academic References**: ยง2.1 Architecture Requirements, ยง3.2 User Experience
**Stakeholders**: Development Team, End Users, Academic Reviewers

## Context

### Problem Statement
The Dizzy's Disease survival RPG needs to support multiple camera perspectives (FPS, TPS, Isometric, Side-scrolling) to accommodate different user preferences and gameplay scenarios. Traditional single-perspective architectures would require significant code duplication and separate systems for each perspective.

### Current Situation
Initial project setup with basic player controller locked to single perspective. Need to establish camera architecture that supports dynamic perspective switching without breaking gameplay mechanics or requiring code duplication.

### Constraints
- Must work with Godot 4.4 architecture
- Performance impact must be minimal (<5% overhead)
- Code maintenance should not increase significantly
- All perspectives must provide equivalent gameplay functionality
- Must support runtime perspective switching

### Requirements
- Support 4 distinct camera perspectives (FPS, TPS, Iso, Side)
- Dynamic perspective switching during gameplay
- Consistent input handling across all perspectives
- Equivalent functionality in all perspectives
- Minimal performance overhead
- Maintainable codebase without duplication

## Decision

### Chosen Solution
Implement a perspective-agnostic architecture using interchangeable camera rigs with a common interface. The PlayerController delegates camera functionality to specialized rig components that can be swapped at runtime.

### Implementation Approach
- Create base CameraRig interface defining common functionality
- Implement specialized rigs for each perspective (FPSRig, TPSRig, IsoRig, SideRig)
- PlayerController owns current rig reference and delegates camera operations
- Perspective switching replaces rig instance while preserving state
- Input system remains perspective-independent

### Key Components
- **CameraRig Interface**: Common contract for all perspective implementations
- **Specialized Rigs**: FPSRig.tscn, TPSRig.tscn, IsoRig.tscn, SideRig.tscn
- **Perspective Manager**: Handles rig instantiation and switching logic
- **Input Abstraction**: Perspective-independent input processing

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Single Camera with Mode Switching
**Description**: One camera node with different behavior modes

**Pros**:
- Simpler initial implementation
- Single camera to manage
- No rig switching overhead

**Cons**:
- Massive monolithic camera class
- Complex conditional logic for each perspective
- Difficult to maintain and extend
- Poor separation of concerns

**Why Rejected**: Would create unmaintainable monolithic camera system with complex conditional logic.

### Alternative 2: Separate Scene Architectures
**Description**: Different scene structures for each perspective

**Pros**:
- Each perspective fully optimized
- No shared complexity
- Clear separation

**Cons**:
- Massive code duplication
- Inconsistent gameplay mechanics
- Complex state synchronization
- Maintenance nightmare

**Why Rejected**: Would violate DRY principle and create maintenance and consistency issues.

### Alternative 3: Component-Based Camera System
**Description**: Compose camera behavior from multiple components

**Pros**:
- High flexibility
- Good separation of concerns
- Reusable components

**Cons**:
- Increased complexity
- Performance overhead from component composition
- Harder to reason about complete behavior

**Why Rejected**: Added complexity outweighed benefits for this specific use case.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Code Reusability**: Shared player logic across all perspectives
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of perspective-specific and shared logic
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new perspectives by implementing interface
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead with efficient rig switching
- **User Experience**: Seamless perspective switching enhances gameplay
- **Academic Compliance**: Demonstrates advanced architectural design patterns

### Negative Consequences
- **Initial Complexity**: More complex initial setup than single-perspective approach
- **Interface Maintenance**: Changes to camera interface require updates to all rigs
- **Memory Overhead**: Multiple rig scenes loaded (mitigated by on-demand loading)

### Neutral Consequences
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand rig-based architecture
- **Testing Complexity**: All features must be tested across all perspectives

## Implementation Details

### Affected Components
- **PlayerController.gd**: Modified to support rig delegation and perspective switching
- **CameraRigs/**: New directory with specialized rig implementations
- **Input System**: Abstracted to work with any perspective
- **UI System**: Adapted to work with different camera configurations

### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Create CameraRig interface and FPS implementation
2. **Phase 2**: Implement TPS, Iso, and Side rigs
3. **Phase 3**: Add perspective switching functionality
4. **Phase 4**: Optimize performance and add polish

### Dependencies
- Godot 4.4 Camera3D node capabilities
- Input system abstraction layer
- Scene management for rig instantiation

### Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Performance degradation from frequent rig switching
  - **Mitigation**: Implement rig caching and lazy instantiation
  - **Monitoring**: Frame rate monitoring during perspective switches
