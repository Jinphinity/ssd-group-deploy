**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2024-01-16
**Category**: Technology Choice
**Academic References**: §14 Error Handling and Resilience, §15 Data Validation
**Stakeholders**: Development Team, End Users, System Operations, Academic Reviewers

## Context

### Problem Statement
The Dizzy's Disease client-server architecture requires robust error handling for network operations, API calls, and data synchronization. Simple retry mechanisms can overwhelm servers during outages and create cascading failures. Need intelligent retry strategy that balances responsiveness with system stability.

### Current Situation
Basic error handling with no retry logic. Failed operations simply fail permanently, creating poor user experience and data loss scenarios. Network interruptions, temporary server issues, and transient errors cause permanent failures.

### Constraints
- Must prevent server overwhelming during outages
- Should provide good user experience during temporary issues
- Memory usage for retry state must be bounded
- Implementation must be maintainable and debuggable
- Must integrate with existing logging and monitoring

### Requirements
- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Intelligent backoff to prevent server overwhelming
- Configurable retry limits and timing
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Graceful failure after exhausting retries
- Support for different error types with different strategies

## Decision

### Chosen Solution
Implement exponential backoff retry mechanism with jitter, structured logging, and configurable parameters. Use 7-stage delay sequence: [1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 16.0, 32.0, 60.0] seconds with maximum 6 retries.

### Implementation Approach
- Save.gd implements retry logic with exponential backoff timing
- Each retry attempt includes correlation ID for tracking
- Structured logging captures retry attempts, successes, and failures
- Configurable retry delays and maximum retry counts
- Graceful degradation after exhausting all retry attempts

### Key Components
- **Retry Timer**: Godot Timer node for managing retry delays
- **Retry State**: Dictionary tracking current retry attempt and parameters
- **Backoff Sequence**: Predefined array of delay intervals
- **Correlation IDs**: Unique identifiers for tracking request lifecycle
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs with retry metadata

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Fixed Interval Retry
**Description**: Retry with consistent delay between attempts

**Pros**:
- Simple to implement and understand
- Predictable timing behavior
- Easy to test and debug

**Cons**:
- Can overwhelm servers during outages
- No adaptation to server load
- Inefficient for varying error types

**Why Rejected**: Fixed intervals risk server overwhelming and don't adapt to changing conditions.

### Alternative 2: Linear Backoff
**Description**: Linearly increasing delays (1s, 2s, 3s, 4s...)

**Pros**:
- Gradual increase in retry intervals
- Simple mathematical progression
- Better than fixed intervals

**Cons**:
- Slower adaptation than exponential
- Still risk of server overwhelming
- Not industry standard approach

**Why Rejected**: Linear progression doesn't provide sufficient protection against server overwhelming.

### Alternative 3: No Retry Logic
**Description**: Fail immediately on any error

**Pros**:
- Simplest implementation
- No retry-related complexity
- Immediate failure feedback

**Cons**:
- Poor user experience
- Data loss on transient failures
- No resilience to temporary issues

**Why Rejected**: Fails to meet resilience and user experience requirements.

### Alternative 4: Circuit Breaker Pattern
**Description**: Stop retrying after detecting systematic failures

**Pros**:
- Excellent server protection
- Industry standard pattern
- Adaptive to failure patterns

**Cons**:
- Complex implementation
- Requires failure pattern detection
- May be overkill for client-side use

**Why Rejected**: Added complexity not justified for current requirements; could be future enhancement.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Resilience**: Automatic recovery from transient failures improves system stability
- **User Experience**: Seamless handling of temporary network issues
- **Server Protection**: Exponential backoff prevents server overwhelming during outages

### Negative Consequences
- **Complexity**: More complex error handling logic requiring careful testing
- **Resource Usage**: Retry state and timers consume memory and processing
- **Delayed Failure**: User waits longer before definitive failure notification
- **Potential Confusion**: Users may not understand why operations take longer

### Neutral Consequences
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand exponential backoff concepts
- **Testing Requirements**: Need to test retry scenarios and edge cases
- **Monitoring Needs**: Requires monitoring of retry patterns and success rates
