# Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains architectural decision records for Dizzy's Disease.

## Overview

Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) document important architectural decisions made during development. They provide context for why decisions were made and help future developers understand the reasoning behind design choices.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a structured format based on Michael Nygard's template:

1. **Status**: [Proposed|Accepted|Deprecated|Superseded]
2. **Context**: The architectural challenge or problem
3. **Decision**: The architectural decision made
4. **Consequences**: The positive and negative impacts

## Naming Convention

ADRs are numbered sequentially and use descriptive titles:

Format: `ADR-XXXX-[short-title].md`

Examples:
- `ADR-0001-perspective-agnostic-architecture.md`
- `ADR-0002-hybrid-authority-model.md`
- `ADR-0003-exponential-backoff-retry.md`

## Decision Categories

### System Architecture
- Core system design patterns
- Component interaction models
- Data flow architectures
- Performance optimization strategies

### Technology Choices
- Framework and library selections
- Database design decisions
- API design patterns
- Security implementation approaches

### Academic Compliance
- Requirement interpretation decisions
- Implementation strategy choices
- Quality gate definitions
- Validation approach selections

## Current ADRs

| ID | Title | Status | Date | Category |
|----|-------|--------|------|----------|
| 0001 | Perspective-Agnostic Camera Architecture | Accepted | 2024-01-XX | System Architecture |
| 0002 | Hybrid Authority Model for Game Systems | Accepted | 2024-01-XX | System Architecture |
| 0003 | Exponential Backoff for Error Recovery | Accepted | 2024-01-XX | Technology Choice |
| 0004 | Structured Logging with Correlation IDs | Accepted | 2024-01-XX | Technology Choice |
| 0005 | Comprehensive Input Validation Framework | Accepted | 2024-01-XX | Academic Compliance |

## ADR Lifecycle

### 1. Proposed
- Decision is under consideration
- Context and options are documented
- Stakeholder review is in progress

### 2. Accepted
- Decision has been approved
- Implementation can proceed
- Decision is now part of architectural baseline

### 3. Deprecated
- Decision is no longer recommended
- Existing implementations may remain
- New implementations should avoid this approach

### 4. Superseded
- Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR
- References the superseding ADR
- Historical context is preserved

## Creating New ADRs

### 1. Copy Template
```bash
cp ADR/TEMPLATE.md ADR/ADR-XXXX-[short-title].md
```

### 2. Fill in Details
- Update metadata (ID, title, date, status)
- Document context and problem statement
- Describe the decision and alternatives considered
- Analyze consequences and trade-offs

### 3. Review Process
- Technical review by development team
- Academic compliance review
- Stakeholder approval
- Update status to "Accepted"

### 4. Implementation
- Reference ADR in related code
- Update documentation
- Monitor consequences and outcomes

## Integration with Development

### Code References
ADRs should be referenced in code comments for significant architectural decisions:

```gdscript
# ADR-0001: Perspective-agnostic camera system
# This implementation supports dynamic perspective switching
```

### Task Management
Tasks implementing ADR decisions should reference the relevant ADR:

```markdown
**Related ADRs**: ADR-0002 (Hybrid Authority Model)
```

### Changelog Integration
ADR implementations should be documented in CHANGELOG.md:

```markdown
### Added
- Hybrid authority model implementation (ADR-0002)
```

## Quality Assurance

### Review Criteria
- [ ] Problem clearly defined
- [ ] Decision rationale documented
- [ ] Alternatives considered and analyzed
- [ ] Consequences identified and assessed
- [ ] Academic compliance addressed
- [ ] Implementation guidance provided

### Maintenance
- Regular review of existing ADRs
- Update status as decisions evolve
- Create superseding ADRs when needed
- Maintain decision traceability

## Academic Compliance Integration

ADRs support academic requirements by:

- **ยง14 Error Handling**: Documenting error recovery strategies
- **ยง15 Data Validation**: Recording validation approach decisions
- **ยง16-20 Quality**: Capturing quality-related architectural choices
- **Requirement Traceability**: Linking decisions to specific requirements

## Stakeholders

### Primary Stakeholders
- **Development Team**: Implementation guidance
- **Academic Reviewers**: Compliance verification
- **Future Developers**: Decision context and rationale

### Review Responsibilities
- **Technical Lead**: Architecture and design review
- **Academic Liaison**: Compliance and requirement review
- **Quality Assurance**: Testing and validation review
